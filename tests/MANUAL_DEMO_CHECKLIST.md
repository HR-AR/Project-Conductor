# Manual Demo Checklist - "Killer Demo" Validation
**Project Conductor - Component 1.5 Integration Testing**

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12
**Estimated Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Target Audience**: Investors, Stakeholders, QA Team

---

## üéØ Purpose

This checklist validates the complete "Killer Demo" story that showcases Project Conductor's AI orchestration capabilities. The demo demonstrates how agents autonomously detect conflicts and pause workflows for human intervention.

**Key Moment**: When the Security Agent detects a vulnerability and the system autonomously pauses to request human intervention - this is the "magic" investors need to see.

## üé≠ Demo Presentation Tips

### Setup (5 minutes before demo)
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Restart Node.js application for fresh logs
3. Pre-load dashboard to test WebSocket connection
4. Prepare Settings panel (have it open in separate window if needed)
5. Test conflict button once to verify modal appears
6. Close modal and refresh page for clean demo

### During Demo (10 minutes)
1. **Intro** (1 min): Explain Project Conductor's purpose
2. **Activity Feed** (2 min): Show demo mode, explain agent activity visibility
3. **The Conflict** (3 min): Trigger high severity conflict, emphasize urgency and auto-pause
4. **Module 5 Navigation** (2 min): Show auto-navigation and conflict resolution interface
5. **Resolution** (2 min): Resolve conflict, show workflow resume
6. **Q&A** (5 min): Answer questions, show additional features

### Key Talking Points
- **"Document is the source of truth"**: All orchestration flows from BRD/PRD
- **"Autonomous agents"**: Agents work in parallel, detecting issues proactively
- **"Human-in-the-loop"**: System pauses for critical decisions (not fully autonomous)
- **"Real-time visibility"**: Activity feed shows what AI is doing (no black box)
- **"Democratic conflict resolution"**: Stakeholders vote on solutions (Module 5)

### Troubleshooting During Demo
- **Modal doesn't appear**: Refresh page, check console for errors, verify WebSocket connection
- **Navigation fails**: Manually navigate to Module 5, explain iframe limitation (will be fixed in SPA migration)
- **Activity feed empty**: Use demo mode button, check WebSocket connection
- **Progress tracker doesn't update**: Refresh page, verify JavaScript loaded correctly

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Iframe Loading Delay
**Symptom**: Module 5 takes 2-3 seconds to load after "Resolve Now" clicked
**Workaround**: Pre-load Module 5 before demo by navigating to it once
**Status**: Will be fixed in Phase 3 (SPA Migration)

### Issue 2: WebSocket Connection Drops
**Symptom**: Events stop appearing in activity feed
**Workaround**: Refresh page to reconnect WebSocket
**Status**: Reconnection logic planned for Priority 2

### Issue 3: Modal Not Dismissible
**Symptom**: User can't close modal (by design)
**Workaround**: This is intentional - click "Resolve Now" to proceed
**Status**: Not an issue, but may confuse first-time users

### Issue 4: Conflict Test Button Requires Retry
**Symptom**: First click on test button may not trigger modal
**Workaround**: Click button twice, or wait 1 second after page load
**Status**: Race condition with JavaScript initialization
