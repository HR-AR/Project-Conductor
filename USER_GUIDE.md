   - Notifies relevant stakeholders

2. **Review Conflict**
   ```
   Conflict: Security vs Performance

   Requirement 1 (BRD-003):

   "Search results must load in < 100ms"

   Issue: Encryption overhead may impact performance
   ```

3. **Propose Options**
   ```
   Option 1: Full Encryption
   Pros: Maximum security
   Cons: May slow search

   Option 2: Selective Encryption
   Pros: Balanced approach
   Cons: More complex implementation

   Option 3: Performance First
   Pros: Fastest search
   Cons: Security risk
   ```

4. **Democratic Voting**
   ```
   Vote on preferred option:

   Stakeholders (5 total):
   ✓ Option 1: 1 vote
   ✓ Option 2: 3 votes ← Majority
   ✓ Option 3: 1 vote
   ```

5. **Resolve Conflict**
   - Majority option wins
   - Update affected requirements
   - Document resolution rationale

#### Participating in Voting

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Requirements

#### Do's

✅ **Be Specific**
```
Bad: "System should be fast"
Good: "Search results must load in under 100ms for 95% of queries"
```

✅ **Be Measurable**
```
Bad: "Improve user experience"
Good: "Increase user satisfaction score from 3.5 to 4.5 out of 5"
```

✅ **Be Testable**
```
Bad: "Users should find the app easy to use"
Good: "80% of new users complete onboarding in under 3 minutes"
```

#### Don'ts

❌ **Avoid Ambiguity**
```
Bad: "System usually responds quickly"
Good: "System responds within 200ms for 99% of requests"
```

❌ **Don't Mix Requirements**
```
Bad: "Users can login and see their dashboard and update their profile"
Good: Split into 3 separate requirements
```

❌ **Don't Use Jargon**
```
Bad: "Implement OAuth2 PKCE flow with JWT tokens"
Good (for BRD): "Users can securely login using their email"
Good (for Design): "Implement OAuth2 PKCE flow with JWT tokens"
```

### Workflow Best Practices

2. Document all assumptions
3. Consider scalability and security
4. Get engineering lead approval

#### Implementation Phase
1. Update status regularly
2. Link code commits to requirements
3. Test against acceptance criteria
4. Document any deviations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Can't Submit BRD for Approval

**Problem**: "Submit for Approval" button is disabled

**Solutions**:
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Ensure you have permission to submit
3. Verify BRD is in "draft" status

#### Traceability Links Not Showing

**Problem**: Links between requirements not visible

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check link was created successfully
3. Verify you have permission to view linked requirements

#### Real-time Updates Not Working

**Problem**: Not seeing other users' changes in real-time

**Solutions**:
1. Check WebSocket connection (look for green indicator)
2. Refresh the page to reconnect
3. Check network connectivity
4. Try different browser

#### Can't Vote on Conflict

**Problem**: Vote button is disabled

**Solutions**:
