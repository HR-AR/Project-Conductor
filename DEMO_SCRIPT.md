# Project Conductor - Demo Script & Talking Points

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Audience:** Product Managers, CTOs, Engineering Leaders
**Goal:** Demonstrate how Project Conductor solves the $100B requirements management problem

---

## üìä Opening (2 minutes)

### The Hook
"60% of software failures trace back to poor requirements management. That's a $100 billion problem.

The issue? Requirements live in static documents - Word files, PDFs, scattered Jira tickets. When requirements change, the docs don't update. Code drifts. Nobody knows what was approved, by whom, or why."

### The Vision
"Project Conductor makes the narrative document your single source of truth. Everything - approvals, status, traceability - lives in one living document that syncs automatically."

---

## üöÄ Demo Flow

- Click **"The Problem"** tab to show stats

**Stats to Highlight:**
- 60% of software failures from requirements
- $100B annual cost

## üé§ Q&A Prep

### Common Questions

**Q: "How does this integrate with Jira?"**
A: "We have Jira sync module. Requirements flow bidirectionally - create Jira issues from requirements, sync status back. See [integration-jira.html](integration-jira.html)."

**Q: "What about GitHub integration?"**
A: "Git-native. Documents versioned in Git. Commits link to requirements via tags. Traceability matrix shows code ‚Üî requirement mapping."

**Q: "Can non-technical users use this?"**
A: "Yes! Markdown is simple (like writing an email with ** for bold). Plus we have WYSIWYG editor coming. Non-technical stakeholders mainly vote on approvals."

**Q: "How does real-time collaboration work?"**
A: "WebSocket (Socket.io). Like Google Docs - see cursors, live edits, presence. Works for 100+ concurrent users."

**Q: "What about compliance/audit?"**
A: "Everything recorded. Git history + decision register + change log = immutable audit trail. SOC2/ISO27001 ready."

**Q: "Migration from existing tools?"**
A: "CSV import for requirements. Jira sync for tickets. Scripts to convert Word/Confluence docs to Markdown. Typically 1-2 weeks migration."

**Q: "Pricing?"**
A: "Open source core (MIT license). Enterprise features (SSO, audit, advanced integrations) available. Contact for pricing."

## üé® Presentation Tips

### Visual Flow
1. **Hook with problem** (stats are powerful)
2. **Show the vision** (living documents concept)
3. **Walk through workflow** (let them see each module)
4. **Highlight innovations** (widgets, voting, traceability)
5. **Close with ROI** (hard numbers win)

### Pacing
- **Fast:** Problem/vision (people know the pain)
- **Slow:** Modules 2-3-5 (key differentiators)
- **Medium:** Everything else

### Engagement
- Ask: "How do you currently track approvals?"
- Ask: "What happens when requirements change mid-sprint?"
- Let them click around in modules

### Demo Tips
- Have modules pre-loaded in browser tabs
- Test all links before presenting
- Have backend running (even if mock mode)
- Clear browser cache for clean demo
