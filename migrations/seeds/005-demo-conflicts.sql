  'Critical Security Vulnerability: API Keys in Environment Files',
  'The engineering design proposes storing API keys and secrets in .env files. This is a critical security vulnerability because:

1. **.env files are often committed to version control** - Even if .gitignore is configured, developers may accidentally commit them, exposing credentials
2. **No access control** - Anyone with filesystem access can read plain-text secrets
3. **No audit trail** - Can''t track who accessed keys or detect unauthorized access
4. **No rotation mechanism** - Changing keys requires manual updates across all environments
5. **Compliance violations** - Fails PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and GDPR requirements for credential management

**Detected in**: DESIGN-2024-001 - Mobile App Redesign
**Vulnerable code mention**: "Store API keys and secrets in .env files for easy configuration management"

**Industry Best Practices**:
- Use dedicated secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault)
- Implement secret rotation
- Enforce access controls and audit logging
- Never store secrets in source code or environment files',
