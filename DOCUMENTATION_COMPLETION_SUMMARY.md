- **Figma**: Playground files (integrated)
- **Linear**: Demo workspaces (same app)

**Recommendation**: Create demo endpoints (`/api/v1/demo/*`) with feature flags
- **Benefits**: Always in sync, self-service, low maintenance ($12.4K 5-year cost)
- **Implementation**: 2-3 weeks
- **ROI**: Saves 3-5 hours per demo presentation
