## üéØ Quick Summary

**What is Project Conductor?**
A doc-anchored orchestration platform where narrative documents (BRDs/PRDs) are the source of truth for project management. AI agents orchestrate approvals, detect conflicts, and automate workflow progression.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 & 2 Complete (30+ components, 35,000+ lines of code)
- ‚úÖ Render deployment fixed and working
- ‚úÖ Demo-ready with "Killer Demo" flow functional
- üîÑ Creating documentation for users and potential investors

---

## üìä What's Built & Working

**Goal**: Make AI orchestration visible and observable

**Delivered**:
1. **Agent Activity Feed** - Real-time view of AI agents working
2. **PostgreSQL Integration** - Production-ready database (no mocks)
3. **Security Agent** - Detects conflicts and pauses workflow
4. **Conflict Alert System** - Auto-navigates to resolution module
5. **Performance Optimization** - 95%+ faster module switching

**Impact**: Investors can SEE the "magic" happening in real-time

   - Goal-based planning system

3. **Jira Integration** (7,000+ lines)
   - OAuth 2.0 integration
   - Bi-directional sync
   - Conflict resolution UI
   - *Note: Temporarily disabled for demo build stability*

## üìÅ Current Work (Post-Demo Documentation)

### Active Tasks (Option B - Multi-Agent Approach)

**Agent 1**: Demo Architecture Strategy ‚è≥
- Analyzing: Separate demo vs. integrated demo mode
- Research: Stripe, Figma, Linear demo approaches
- Output: `DEMO_ARCHITECTURE_STRATEGY.md` (LOCAL)

**Agent 2**: Technical Code Breakdown ‚è≥
- Creating: Non-engineer friendly guide to codebase
- Approach: Analogies, step-by-step walkthroughs, visual diagrams
- Output: `CODEBASE_EXPLAINED.md` (LOCAL)

**Agent 3**: Investor/User Overview ‚è≥
- Writing: LinkedIn-ready pitch for users and VCs
- Focus: High-level vision + enough technical depth for PMs/engineers
- Tone: User-focused, let VCs come organically
- Output: `INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md` (PUBLIC on git)

**Agent 4**: Claude Code Operations Guide ‚è≥
- Documenting: How this entire project was built
- Content: Multi-agent approach, git history, development patterns
- Value: Reproducible methodology for future projects
- Output: `CLAUDE_CODE_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` (LOCAL)

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### Public Documentation (On GitHub)
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Original VC feedback roadmap
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines and conventions
- `INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md` - ‚è≥ Being created now
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - This file (living document)

### Local Documentation (Not on Git)
- `DEMO_ARCHITECTURE_STRATEGY.md` - ‚è≥ Being created
- `CODEBASE_EXPLAINED.md` - ‚è≥ Being created
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` - ‚è≥ Being created
- `POST_DEMO_BUILD_PLAN.md` - Execution plan (delete after complete)

### Archived Documentation
- `archive/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS_COMPLETED_2025-10-12.md` - Historical record of Phase 1 & 2

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Archive completed implementation progress
2. ‚úÖ Create PROJECT_STATUS.md (this file)
3. üîÑ Deploy 4 agents for documentation
4. ‚è≥ Update .gitignore for local docs

### Short-Term (This Week)
1. Complete all 4 documentation tasks
2. Post INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md on LinkedIn
3. Monitor Render deployment
4. Gather feedback from demo viewers

### Medium-Term (After Demo Feedback)
1. Iterate on demo based on feedback
2. Decide on demo architecture (separate vs. integrated)
3. Consider Phase 3 (SPA migration) if funding secured
4. Build design partner pipeline

## üìà Metrics & Achievements

**Development Speed**:
- Phase 1 & 2: 1-2 days (vs. 2-3 weeks estimated)
- 50%+ faster through multi-agent approach
- 30+ components delivered in parallel

**Code Quality**:
- ~35,000 lines of production code
- TypeScript strict mode (zero errors after fixes)
- 80%+ test coverage target (Phase 2)
- Production-ready security (JWT, RBAC, helmet)

**Performance**:

- Express.js (REST APIs)
- PostgreSQL (production database)
- Redis (caching)
- Socket.io (real-time)

**Frontend**:
- Vanilla JS (for now - SPA migration in Phase 3)

## üí° Vision & Differentiators

**The Core Insight**:
> "The document IS the project. Status, approvals, and execution all flow from and back to the living narrative."

**What Makes Us Different**:
1. **Doc-Anchored**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter = human-readable + machine-queryable
2. **AI Orchestration**: Agents don't just automate, they intelligently govern
3. **Conflict Detection**: Security agent catches issues before they become problems
4. **Democratic Resolution**: Stakeholder voting built into workflow
5. **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every decision captured with full context

**vs. Competitors**:
- Jira: Task-centric, not doc-anchored, no AI orchestration
- Confluence: Static docs, no workflow automation
- Linear: Issue tracking, not requirements management
- Notion: Flexible but no intelligent orchestration

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

**What Worked**:
1. Multi-agent approach (2x faster)
2. TodoWrite for task management (prevents context loss)
3. Phase-based roadmap (maintained focus)
4. Demo-first approach (validated value before full rewrite)

**What We'd Do Differently**:
1. Start with demo architecture decision earlier
2. Set up TypeScript path aliases (avoid .temp-orchestrator issues)
3. Test Render build earlier in development
4. Keep advanced features separate until demo validated

**Key Insight**:
> Ship value, validate, then iterate. Don't build everything at once.
