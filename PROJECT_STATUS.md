## üí° Vision & Differentiators

**The Core Insight**:
> "The document IS the project. Status, approvals, and execution all flow from and back to the living narrative."

**What Makes Us Different**:
1. **Doc-Anchored**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter = human-readable + machine-queryable
2. **AI Orchestration**: Agents don't just automate, they intelligently govern
3. **Conflict Detection**: Security agent catches issues before they become problems
4. **Democratic Resolution**: Stakeholder voting built into workflow
5. **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every decision captured with full context

**vs. Competitors**:
- Jira: Task-centric, not doc-anchored, no AI orchestration
- Confluence: Static docs, no workflow automation
- Linear: Issue tracking, not requirements management
- Notion: Flexible but no intelligent orchestration

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

**What Worked**:
1. Multi-agent approach (2x faster)
2. TodoWrite for task management (prevents context loss)
3. Phase-based roadmap (maintained focus)
4. Demo-first approach (validated value before full rewrite)

**What We'd Do Differently**:
1. Start with demo architecture decision earlier
2. Set up TypeScript path aliases (avoid .temp-orchestrator issues)
3. Test Render build earlier in development
4. Keep advanced features separate until demo validated

**Key Insight**:
> Ship value, validate, then iterate. Don't build everything at once.
