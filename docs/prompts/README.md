# Scout Prompts

This directory contains AI-ready prompts generated by the Scout CLI for researching implementation patterns.

## What is Scout?

Scout is a Context Engineering tool that:
1. Reads your PRP (Project Requirements Plan) or INITIAL.md
2. Extracts your tech stack from CLAUDE.md
3. Generates a comprehensive research prompt
4. Outputs it ready to paste into AI assistants (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT)

## Workflow

### 1. Create Your Feature Request
First, document your feature in either:
- **PRP file** in `docs/prps/` (run `npm run gen-prp`)
- **INITIAL.md** for quick captures

### 2. Generate Scout Prompt
```bash
# Use the latest PRP
npm run scout

# Use a specific PRP
npm run scout -- --from docs/prps/PRP-specific-feature-2024-01-15.md

# Use INITIAL.md
npm run scout:initial

# Custom output location
npm run scout -- --out docs/prompts/custom-name.md
```

### 3. Get AI Research
1. Open the generated file in `docs/prompts/`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into your AI assistant of choice
4. Review the patterns and examples provided

### 4. Capture Patterns
Save useful patterns from AI responses:
```bash
# Add to notes
npm run note add -- --area api --title "Pattern Name" --content "Key insights from AI"

# Promote to example when ready
npm run note promote -- --area api --title "Pattern Name"
```

## Scout Prompt Structure

Each generated prompt includes:

### Feature Context
- Feature title and description
- Why it's needed (from PRP)
- Planned approach (if available)
- Relevant files to review
- Existing patterns to follow

### Tech Stack
- Current technology stack
- Coding conventions
- Architecture patterns

### Research Tasks
1. **Design Patterns** - Common patterns for the feature type
2. **Public Examples** - Real implementations with URLs
3. **Pattern Details** - For each pattern:
   - Name and use cases
   - Key concepts
   - Trade-offs
   - Minimal TypeScript stub
4. **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid and why
5. **Testing & Security** - Test cases and security considerations

## Example Scout Output

```markdown
Feature: Add Rate Limiting

Why/Context:
- Prevent API abuse
- Ensure fair usage

Our tech stack:
- Node.js + TypeScript
- Express.js
- Redis for caching

Tasks for you:
1) Identify Design Patterns
   - Token bucket
   - Sliding window
   - Fixed window
...
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running Scout
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Ensure tech stack is current
2. **Complete PRP Sections** - More context = better AI results
3. **List Relevant Files** - Help AI understand your architecture

### Using AI Responses
1. **Verify Examples** - Check source URLs provided
2. **Adapt to Your Stack** - Don't copy blindly
3. **Test Thoroughly** - AI code needs validation
4. **Document Sources** - Keep references for team

### Pattern Management
```bash
# Workflow: Scout → Notes → Examples
npm run scout                    # Generate research prompt
# → Paste to AI, get patterns
npm run note add ...             # Capture patterns
npm run note promote ...         # Create stub
# → Implement and test
```

## File Naming Convention

Scout files are named:
```
SCOUT-[feature-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
```

Examples:
- `SCOUT-rate-limiting-2024-01-15.md`
- `SCOUT-user-authentication-2024-01-16.md`

## Integration with Other Tools

### PRP System
- Scout reads PRPs automatically
- Extracts goals, context, and approach
- Uses "Relevant Files" and "Pattern References"

### Notes CLI
- Save AI-provided patterns to notes
- Organize by area (api, database, etc.)
- Promote best patterns to examples

### Validation
After implementing AI suggestions:
```bash
npm run validate  # Run all checks
npm test         # Verify functionality
```

## Tips for Better Results

### In Your PRP/INITIAL.md
- Be specific about requirements
- List constraints and limitations
- Include performance needs
- Mention security requirements

### In CLAUDE.md
- Keep tech stack updated
- Document coding conventions
- List architectural patterns
- Include anti-patterns to avoid

### When Prompting AI
- Ask for TypeScript if that's your language
- Request specific framework versions
- Ask for error handling patterns
- Request test examples

## Troubleshooting

### No PRP Found
- Run `npm run gen-prp` first
- Or use `--from INITIAL.md`

### Stack Not Found
- Update CLAUDE.md with Tech Stack section
- Use `--stackFrom` to specify different file

### Output Issues
- Check `docs/prompts/` directory exists
- Use `--out` for custom location
- Ensure write permissions

## Archive

Move old scout prompts to archive:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/prompts/archive
mv docs/prompts/SCOUT-old-*.md docs/prompts/archive/
```

## Security Notes

- Scout prompts don't contain sensitive data
- Review before sharing with external AI
- Remove any accidental credentials
- Keep proprietary logic out of prompts
