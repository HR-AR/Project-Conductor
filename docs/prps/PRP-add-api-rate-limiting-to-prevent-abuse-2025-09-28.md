# Feature: Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse
Generated: 2025-09-28

## Goal & Why
We need to implement rate limiting middleware to protect our API endpoints from abuse and ensure fair resource allocation across all clients.

**Business Value:**
- Prevent DoS attacks on public endpoints that could impact service availability
- Ensure fair resource usage across clients preventing any single user from monopolizing resources
- Reduce infrastructure costs by preventing unnecessary load
- Improve overall API reliability and user experience

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement per-IP and per-user rate limiting
- Support different limits for different endpoint types
- Provide clear rate limit headers in responses
- Enable Redis-based distributed rate limiting for scalability

## Context
### Relevant Files
- Review: src/index.ts (main app setup, middleware pipeline)
- Review: src/middleware/error-handler.ts (existing middleware patterns)
- Review: src/middleware/rate-limit.ts (placeholder file if exists)
- Review: src/routes/requirements.routes.ts (existing rate limiting usage)
- Review: docker-compose.yml (Redis service configuration)

### Pattern References
- Follow pattern from: examples/middleware/rate-limiter-factory.example.ts (configurable middleware factory)
- Follow pattern from: examples/middleware/redis-sliding-window.example.ts (Redis sorted sets implementation)
- Follow pattern from: examples/middleware/resilient-store-proxy.example.ts (circuit breaker with fallback)
- Follow pattern from: examples/tests/rate-limiter.test.example.ts (comprehensive testing approach)
- Avoid anti-patterns from: examples/middleware/rate-limiting-antipatterns.md
- Reference: examples/api/validation-chain.example.ts (middleware composition)
- Reference: examples/api/requirements-crud.example.ts (existing rate limit setup)

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Core Rate Limiting Middleware
1. Create `src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`:
   - Implement sliding window algorithm
   - Support both Redis and in-memory stores
   - Configure per-route limits

2. Define rate limit strategies:
   - Public endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes
   - Authenticated endpoints: 1000 requests per 15 minutes
   - Write operations: 20 requests per 15 minutes
   - Health check: No limit

### Phase 2: Redis Integration
3. Update Redis configuration:
   - Add rate limit key namespace
   - Implement sliding window with Redis sorted sets
   - Add connection pooling for performance

4. Create fallback mechanism:
   - Graceful degradation to in-memory when Redis unavailable
   - Log Redis connection issues
   - Maintain rate limiting even during Redis outages

### Phase 3: Response Headers & Client Feedback
5. Implement standard rate limit headers:
   - X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed
   - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests remaining in window
   - X-RateLimit-Reset: Window reset timestamp
   - Retry-After: Seconds until next request allowed (when limited)

6. Create custom error responses:
   - 429 Too Many Requests with clear message
   - Include rate limit information in response body
   - Suggest alternatives or upgrade options

### Phase 4: Configuration & Monitoring
7. Add configuration options:
   - Environment variables for limits
   - Per-route configuration
   - Bypass for trusted IPs (internal services)

8. Add monitoring:
   - Log rate limit violations
   - Track metrics for analysis
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
9. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for rate limiter logic
   - Integration tests with Redis
   - Load tests to verify limits
   - Test fallback mechanisms

10. Update documentation:
    - API documentation with rate limits
    - Configuration guide
    - Troubleshooting section

## Validation Loop
Task is ONLY complete when ALL of these pass:
- npm run lint (no errors or warnings)
- npm test (all tests pass, including new rate limit tests)
- npm run build (successful compilation)
- npm run validate (all checks pass)
- Manual testing: Verify rate limiting works with curl/Postman
- Redis integration: Test with docker-compose up
- Load test: Verify performance under load

## Success Criteria
- All validation commands pass
- Code follows examples/ patterns
- Tests provide adequate coverage (>80% for new code)
- Rate limiting works for all endpoint types
- Redis integration with fallback to in-memory
- Clear error messages and headers for clients
- No performance degradation under normal load
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Security review passed (no bypass vulnerabilities)

## Security Considerations
- Prevent rate limit bypass via header manipulation
- Ensure distributed rate limiting across multiple instances
- Protect against slowloris and similar attacks
- Implement IP-based blocking for severe violations
- Consider implementing CAPTCHA for repeated violations

## Performance Targets
- Rate limit check: < 5ms per request
- Redis lookup: < 2ms average
- Memory usage: < 100MB for 10,000 tracked IPs
- No noticeable latency for legitimate requests

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Dynamic rate limits based on user tier
- [ ] Machine learning for anomaly detection
- [ ] Geographic-based rate limiting
- [ ] API key-based rate limiting
- [ ] WebSocket connection limits
