## Historical Context

Project Conductor has completed 6 waves of multi-agent development (documented in `/agent-reports`). The system transitioned from prototype to production-ready through parallel agent execution across backend, frontend, testing, and documentation.

**Current Status**: Investment-ready demo with focus areas identified in `/vc-feedback` and planned in root `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.
