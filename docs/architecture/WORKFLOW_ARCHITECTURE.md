# Project Conductor - Complete Workflow Architecture

## Overview
A comprehensive requirements management system that guides projects from business problem through implementation with multi-stakeholder alignment, conflict resolution, and change tracking.

## Navigation Structure

### Home Dashboard (Not a Tab)

  - Pre-filled "Try It Live" demo
  - Shows complete journey from BRD ‚Üí PRD ‚Üí Implementation
  - Interactive tour button
  - Learn about the system
- **Demo Data**: E-commerce cart abandonment scenario (pre-populated)
- **Action**: User can "Start with This Example" or "Create From Scratch"

#### Tab 1: üí° BRD (Business Requirements Document)
- **Owner**: Business Stakeholders (VP Product, Sales, Marketing)
- **Purpose**: Define the business problem and requirements
- **Content**:
  - Business problem statement
  - Success criteria (measurable)
  - Stakeholder identification
  - Business impact ($2M revenue loss, etc.)
  - Timeline expectations
  - Budget constraints
- **Output**: Approved BRD

#### Tab 2: üìã PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **Owner**: Product Manager
- **Purpose**: Translate BRD into product specifications
- **Content**:
  - Product features derived from BRD
  - User stories
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Technical requirements (high-level)
  - Dependencies
  - Mockups/wireframes
- **Alignment**: All stakeholders (Business + Product + Engineering Leads) must align
- **3-Tier System**: Aligned / Align But (with concerns) / Not Aligned
- **Output**: Approved PRD ready for engineering

#### Tab 3: üîç Engineering Design Review
- **Owner**: Engineering Teams (multiple groups possible)
- **Purpose**: Technical design and feasibility analysis
- **Content**:
  - Architecture design
  - Technical approach per requirement
  - Resource estimates (time, people)
  - Technical risks
  - **Conflict Identification**: "Feature X adds 2 weeks" or "Requires new infrastructure"
  - Alternative approaches
  - Dependencies on other teams
- **Multiple Teams**: Frontend, Backend, Mobile, DevOps, QA can each submit designs
- **Output**: Approved technical design with estimates

#### Tab 4: ‚öñÔ∏è Alignment & Trade-offs
- **Purpose**: Resolve conflicts between Business, Product, Engineering
- **Triggered When**:
  - Timeline estimates exceed BRD expectations
  - Features deemed too complex
  - Budget constraints violated
  - Technical risks identified
- **Content**:
  - **Conflict Display**: "Map feature requires 2-week delay"
  - **Discussion Thread**: Business, Product, Engineering discuss
  - **Options**:
    - Accept delay (update BRD/PRD timelines)
    - Push to Phase 2 (update BRD/PRD scope)
    - Simplify feature (update PRD requirements)
    - Increase resources (update BRD budget)
  - **Decision Tracking**: Who approved, what changed, why
- **Output**: Updated BRD + PRD + Change Log

#### Tab 5: üî® Implementation (TPM Interface)
- **Owner**: Technical Program Manager (TPM) or Engineering Manager
- **Purpose**: Track actual development work
- **Content**:
  - Epics, Stories, Tasks (Jira-style)
  - Assigned to specific engineering teams/individuals
  - Progress tracking (Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Done)
  - Blockers and dependencies
  - **AI Coding Integration**:
    - Option to generate code with AI
    - Review AI-generated code
    - Merge into codebase
  - **Manual Development**: Traditional task tracking
  - Code review status
  - Test coverage
- **Real-time Updates**: As tasks complete, PRD requirements marked as done
- **Output**: Shipped features

#### Tab 6: üìä Change Impact & History
- **Purpose**: Audit trail and impact analysis
- **Content**:
  - **Change Log**:
    - What was pushed (e.g., "Map feature ‚Üí Phase 2")
    - Why it was pushed ("Adds 2 weeks, conflicts with launch date")
    - Who approved (Business + Product + Engineering leads)
    - When it was decided
  - **Impact Analysis**:
    - If we change requirement X, what else is affected?
    - Show traceability links
    - Show dependent requirements
  - **Version History**: BRD v1 ‚Üí v2 ‚Üí v3, PRD v1 ‚Üí v2
  - **Approval Timeline**: Visual timeline of who approved what when

## Key Workflows

### Happy Path (No Conflicts)
1. Business creates BRD ‚Üí Stakeholders align ‚Üí Approved
2. PM creates PRD from BRD ‚Üí All align ‚Üí Approved
3. Engineering designs solution ‚Üí Estimates within expectations ‚Üí Approved
4. TPM breaks down into tasks ‚Üí Engineers implement ‚Üí Ship

### Conflict Path (Timeline Conflict)
1. Business creates BRD (wants feature by Q2)
2. PM creates PRD (includes map feature)
3. Engineering estimates: "Map adds 2 weeks, misses Q2 deadline"
4. **Conflict Detected** ‚Üí Navigate to Alignment tab
5. Discussion:
   - Business: "Q2 deadline is critical for trade show"
   - Product: "Map is #1 requested feature"
   - Engineering: "Can simplify to static map (1 week) or push to Q3"
6. **Decision**: Simplify to static map for Q2, interactive map in Q3
7. **Updates**:
   - PRD updated: "Static map in Phase 1, interactive map in Phase 2"
   - BRD updated: "Phase 1 Q2, Phase 2 Q3"
   - Change Log: "Interactive map ‚Üí Phase 2 (resource constraints)"
8. Engineering re-designs with simplified approach ‚Üí Approved
9. Implementation proceeds
