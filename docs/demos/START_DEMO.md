# ðŸš€ How to Start the Project Conductor Demo

## âœ… Quick Start (Server is Already Running!)

Your server is **already running** at http://localhost:3000! Just open the demo:

```bash
# Open the live interactive demo
open live-demo.html
```

That's it! The demo will open in your browser and connect to the running API.

The server is ready when you see:
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If the demo won't connect:

1. **Check if server is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

2. **If not running, start it:**
```bash
USE_MOCK_DB=true npm run dev
```

3. **If port 3000 is busy:**
```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Start on different port
PORT=3001 USE_MOCK_DB=true npm run dev
```

### If you see "No requirements":

```bash
# Add demo data
./populate-demo-data.sh
```
