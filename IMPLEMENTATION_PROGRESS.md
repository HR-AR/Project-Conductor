## üìù Notes & Blockers

### Current Blockers
*No blockers at this time*

### Technical Decisions Needed
- [ ] Decision: Which WebSocket event format? (JSON vs MessagePack)
- [ ] Decision: Activity log retention policy? (30 days? 90 days?)
- [ ] Decision: Real-time conflict resolution UI design (modal vs panel?)

### Risks & Mitigation
1. **Risk**: PostgreSQL migration breaks existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing before defaulting
   - **Status**: Planned in Task 2.4

2. **Risk**: Agent activity feed impacts performance
   - **Mitigation**: Event throttling and batching
   - **Status**: To be implemented in Component 1.2

3. **Risk**: Conflict detection too sensitive (false positives)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with conservative rules, tune based on feedback
   - **Status**: Will monitor during Component 1.3

### Demo Effectiveness
- [ ] 80%+ "very impressive" rating from investors (Target)
