- [x] Conflict metadata includes vulnerability details, severity, recommendations

**Mock Vulnerabilities Detected** (10 patterns):
1. "Use of deprecated crypto library (crypto-js < 4.0)" - HIGH
2. "Hardcoded API credentials in environment variables" - CRITICAL ‚úÖ
3. "SQL injection vulnerability in user input handling" - CRITICAL ‚úÖ
4. "Missing input validation on public endpoints" - HIGH
5. "Weak password policy" - MEDIUM

7. "Cross-site scripting (XSS)" - CRITICAL
8. "Sensitive data exposure in logs/errors" - HIGH
9. "Insecure deserialization" - MEDIUM
10. "Insufficient logging" - MEDIUM

**Implementation Details**:
- **Agent Type**: `AgentType.SECURITY = 'agent-security'`
- **Phase**: Primarily active in Phase 4 (Quality & Validation)
- **Dependencies**: Models, API agents
- **Scan Method**: Pattern-based regex matching against engineering design content
- **Conflict Handling**: Returns `success: false` with `error: 'SECURITY_CONFLICT'` and detailed metadata
- **WebSocket Events**:
  - `agent.started` - Security scan begins
  - `agent.conflict_detected` - Vulnerability found
  - `agent.paused` - Workflow paused for resolution
  - `agent.completed` - Scan complete (if no vulnerabilities)
- **Mock Engineering Design**: Hardcoded sample with intentional "API keys in .env" vulnerability for reliable demo
- **Test Results**: Successfully detected 2 critical vulnerabilities in test run (VULN-002, VULN-003)

**Demo Flow**:
1. Engineering design document created with text: "store API keys in .env files"
2. AgentSecurity scans document (800ms simulated delay)
3. Detects VULN-002 (Hardcoded API Credentials - CRITICAL)
4. Detects VULN-003 (SQL injection mention - CRITICAL)
5. Returns CONFLICT with full vulnerability details
6. OrchestratorEngine checks `result.error === 'SECURITY_CONFLICT'`
7. Emits `agent.conflict_detected` via ActivityService ‚Üí WebSocket
8. Emits `agent.paused` via ActivityService ‚Üí WebSocket
9. Emits `workflow-paused` event for UI to navigate to Module 5
10. Frontend Activity Feed shows conflict, Conflict Alert modal appears
11. User navigates to Module 5 (Alignment) to resolve
12. After resolution, workflow resumes

**Testing**:
- Created standalone test script: `.temp-orchestrator/test-security-agent.ts`
- Test output: Detected 2 critical vulnerabilities successfully
- Verified conflict metadata structure matches ActivityService expectations
- Confirmed agent follows BaseAgent patterns (capabilities, canHandleTask, estimateTaskDuration)

**Demo Flow Test** (Full Sequence):
1. ‚úÖ User viewing any module (Module 2, 3, or 4)
2. ‚úÖ Open Settings panel (‚öôÔ∏è button)
3. ‚úÖ Click "‚ö†Ô∏è High Severity" test button
4. ‚úÖ **BOOM** - Conflict modal slides in from center (impossible to miss)
5. ‚úÖ Progress tracker immediately turns red/yellow with ‚è∏Ô∏è pause icon
6. ‚úÖ Activity feed shows new conflict event with üîí security icon
7. ‚úÖ User reads conflict: "Hardcoded API Credentials" with full description
8. ‚úÖ User clicks "Resolve Now ‚Üí" button (animated hover effect)
9. ‚úÖ Modal smoothly fades out
10. ‚úÖ Dashboard navigates to Module 5 (Alignment) automatically
11. ‚úÖ Pending conflict banner appears at top with yellow/orange gradient
12. ‚úÖ User clicks "View Details" button in banner
13. ‚úÖ Conflict added to conflict list (top position, marked active)
14. ‚úÖ Center panel updates with full conflict metadata
15. ‚úÖ Active Conflicts counter increments to 4
16. ‚úÖ User can now work through resolution options in Module 5
17. ‚úÖ To test resume: Open Settings ‚Üí Click "‚úì Resume Workflow"
18. ‚úÖ Progress tracker returns to normal (green gradient)
19. ‚úÖ Success toast appears: "Workflow Resumed"
20. ‚úÖ Activity feed shows "Workflow resumed" event

**Technical Integration**:
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Listens for events from Component 1.2 (Orchestrator Event Logging)
- **Activity Feed Integration**: Adds conflict events to Component 1.1 (Activity Feed)
- **Navigation System**: Uses existing `navigateToModule(5)` function from dashboard
- **State Management**: Uses browser sessionStorage API for cross-module context
- **Modal Architecture**: Creates DOM elements dynamically if not present (defensive programming)
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks with console logging for debugging
- **Custom Events**: Emits `conflict:detected`, `conflict:navigation`, `workflow:resumed` for other components

**Known Limitations**:
- Actual workflow resume requires Component 1.3 (Security Agent) to be fully integrated with orchestrator
- Real conflict resolution logic needs backend API endpoints (conflicts service)
- WebSocket events currently simulated via test buttons (production will use real orchestrator events)
- Mock data used for testing (production will have real vulnerability scan results)

**Next Steps** (for Component 1.5 - Integration Testing):
- Connect to real orchestrator WebSocket events
- Test full end-to-end flow with Security Agent
- Integrate with conflicts API for resolution persistence
- Add conflict resolution history tracking
- Implement stakeholder notification on conflict detected

### Priority 7: React/Next.js Migration (EPIC-001)
**Status**: ‚¨ú NOT STARTED

---

## üìù Notes & Blockers

### Current Blockers
*No blockers at this time*

### Technical Decisions Needed
- [ ] Decision: Which WebSocket event format? (JSON vs MessagePack)
- [ ] Decision: Activity log retention policy? (30 days? 90 days?)
- [ ] Decision: Real-time conflict resolution UI design (modal vs panel?)

### Risks & Mitigation
1. **Risk**: PostgreSQL migration breaks existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing before defaulting
   - **Status**: Planned in Task 2.4

2. **Risk**: Agent activity feed impacts performance
   - **Mitigation**: Event throttling and batching
   - **Status**: To be implemented in Component 1.2

3. **Risk**: Conflict detection too sensitive (false positives)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with conservative rules, tune based on feedback
   - **Status**: Will monitor during Component 1.3

- [ ] PostgreSQL integration: 100% complete (no mock DB)
- [ ] Module navigation: <500ms (Target: <200ms in Phase 3)
- [ ] WebSocket latency: <80ms
- [ ] Integration test coverage: 75%+
- [ ] API response time: <500ms uncached

### Investment Readiness Indicators
- [ ] VC feedback blockers #1-3 addressed (iframe still present but improved)
