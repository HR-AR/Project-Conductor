- âœ… `.claude/scripts/skill_learner.py` - Pattern detection engine (342 lines)
- âœ… `.claude/skills/skill-generator/SKILL.md` - Meta-skill documentation
- âœ… `.claude/README.md` - Complete system documentation

### 2. Auto-Generated Directories
- âœ… `.claude/learning/` - Pattern tracking database
- âœ… `.claude/skills/` - Skill storage
- âœ… `.claude/scripts/` - Python scripts

### 3. Documentation Updates
- âœ… `CLAUDE.md` - Added complete Self-Learning Skill System section (lines 845-1474)

## Demo Skill Created

A demo skill was automatically generated to verify the system works:

**Skill**: `auto-analysis-219c9431a85d`
- **Intent**: Analysis
- **Triggers**: "analyze this brd", "analyze the brd"
- **Instructions**: 5-step BRD analysis methodology
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/auto-analysis-219c9431a85d/SKILL.md`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View help
./skill-learner

# Track a new pattern interactively
./skill-learner track

# Record a pattern programmatically
./skill-learner record "request description" "step-by-step instructions"

# List all learned skills
./skill-learner list
```

## How to Use

### Method 1: Interactive Learning
```bash
./skill-learner track
# Follow the prompts to describe your request and methodology
```

### Method 2: Programmatic Recording
```bash
./skill-learner record \
  "Deploy to production" \
  "1) Check env vars 2) Run tests 3) Build Docker 4) Push to registry 5) Update k8s"
```

### Method 3: Natural Conversation
Just explain your workflow to Claude 2+ times with similar instructions, and the system will auto-create a skill.

## Example: Creating a BRD Analysis Skill

### Step 1: First Request
```
You: "Analyze this BRD. First read the executive summary, then check competitive 
      landscape, then evaluate market size, then assess technical feasibility."
      
Claude: [Executes analysis]
System: âœ… Tracked pattern: analysis (seen 1 times)
```

### Step 2: Second Request
```
You: "Analyze the new warehouse BRD using the same methodology."

Claude: [Executes analysis]
System: âœ… Tracked pattern: analysis (seen 2 times)
        ðŸŽ¯ Pattern detected 2 times - generating skill!
        âœ… Created new skill: auto-analysis-[id]
```

### Step 3: Future Requests
```
You: "Analyze the mobile app BRD."

Claude: âœ… Using your custom analysis methodology skill...
        [Auto-executes 5-step analysis without needing instructions]
```

## Skill Types Auto-Detected

The system recognizes these intent patterns:

1. **analysis** - Document/code analysis workflows
2. **api_docs** - API documentation (auto-enables web search)
3. **reporting** - Status reports and summaries
4. **search** - Finding files/code/information
5. **comparison** - Comparing alternatives
6. **validation** - Testing and verification
7. **generation** - Creating new code/docs

## Benefits for Project Conductor

### 1. Reduced Repetition
- Explain workflows once, reuse forever
- No need to re-type detailed instructions

### 2. Consistency
- Same methodology applied every time
- Reduces human error and variance

### 3. Knowledge Capture
- Team workflows become permanent skills
- Onboarding becomes faster

### 4. Self-Improving
- Skills refine with each use
- Can be manually edited for improvements

### 5. Team Collaboration
- Share skills via git
- Standardize team processes

## Configuration

### Adjust Threshold
Edit `.claude/scripts/skill_learner.py`:

```python
self.threshold = 2  # Default: Create skill after 2 similar requests
```

### Add Custom Intent Keywords
Edit the `keywords` dictionary in `extract_intent()` method:

```python
keywords = {
    "analysis": ["analyze", "analysis", "break down", "examine", "evaluate"],
    "deployment": ["deploy", "push", "release"],  # Add custom
    # ...
}
```

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Help Output
```bash
./skill-learner
# Expected: Shows commands (track, list, record)
```

### Test 2: List Skills
```bash
./skill-learner list
# Expected: Shows demo analysis skill + patterns being tracked
```

### Test 3: Create New Skill
```bash
# Record first pattern
./skill-learner record "Check API status" "1) Ping health endpoint 2) Check response time"

# Record second pattern (same intent)
./skill-learner record "Verify API health" "1) Ping health endpoint 2) Check response time"

# Verify skill created
./skill-learner list
# Expected: Shows new auto-validation-[id] skill
```

## Maintenance

### View Pattern Database
```bash
cat .claude/learning/patterns.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

### View All Skills
```bash
ls -la .claude/skills/
```

### Delete a Skill
```bash
rm -rf .claude/skills/auto-analysis-[id]
```

### Clean Pattern Database
```bash
# Backup first
cp .claude/learning/patterns.json .claude/learning/patterns.json.backup

# Edit manually
nano .claude/learning/patterns.json
```

## Git Integration

### Keep Learning Private (Recommended)
Add to `.gitignore`:
```
.claude/learning/
```

### Share Skills with Team (Optional)
Commit skills to share:
```bash
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add team workflow skills"
git push
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try It Out**: Run `./skill-learner track` and create your first skill
2. **Natural Learning**: Just work normally - skills will auto-generate from patterns
3. **Review Skills**: Run `./skill-learner list` periodically to see what's learned
4. **Refine Skills**: Edit `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files to improve
5. **Share**: Commit useful skills to help your team

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Command not found"
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x skill-learner
```

### Issue: "Python module not found"
```bash
# Verify Python 3 is installed
python3 --version

# Should be 3.6+
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x skill-learner
chmod +x .claude/scripts/skill_learner.py
```

### Issue: Skills not auto-invoking
- Skills are for future use (not retroactive)
- Ensure trigger phrases match your request
- Claude must detect the pattern in conversation
